###First Step:
To build a user focus on Vagrant.

``` bash
root$ adduser _username_
visudo
```

### Install VirtualBox

``` bash
$sudo apt-get install dkms
$wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc
$sudo apt-key add oracle_vbox.asc
$sudo apt-get update 
$sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3 -y
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo adduser _username_ vboxusers
```

### Install Vagrant
``` bash
$wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.8.4/vagrant_1.8.4_x86_64.debsudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.8.4
$sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.8.4_x86_64.deb
$vagrant init precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
$vagrant up

==> default: Booting VM...
==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
The guest machine entered an invalid state while waiting for it
to boot. Valid states are 'starting, running'. The machine is in the
'poweroff' state. Please verify everything is configured
properly and try again.

If the provider you're using has a GUI that comes with it,
it is often helpful to open that and watch the machine, since the
GUI often has more helpful error messages than Vagrant can retrieve.
For example, if you're using VirtualBox, run `vagrant up` while the
VirtualBox GUI is open.

The primary issue for this error is that the provider you're using
is not properly configured. This is very rarely a Vagrant issue.
