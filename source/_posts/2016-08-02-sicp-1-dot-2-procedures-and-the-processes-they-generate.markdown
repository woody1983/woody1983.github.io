A section from the book , is very impressed me.

>We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used primitive arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations, and we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as compound procedures.

>But that is not enough to enable us to say that we know how to program. Our situation is analogous to that of someone who has learned the rules for now the pieces move in chess but knows nothing of typical **openings**, **tactics**, or **strategy**. Like the novice chess player, we don't yet know the common patterns of usage in the domain. We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making (which  procedures are worth defining) We lack the experience to predict the consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).
